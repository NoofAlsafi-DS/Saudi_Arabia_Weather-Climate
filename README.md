### Introduction
Weather data are interesting resources, not only for weather forecasting but also for dozens of other purposes across different industries. A central area is certainly understanding climate change. A very large amount of weather data is recorded because of the number of sites, the number of data elements and because the observations are recorded hourly.
Data scientists analyze weathr data collected from weather stations around the globe to forecast how climate trends and events unfold. Because the amounts of data, climate analytics is a common application area for Big Data technology and distributed computing.

### Weather and Climate in 2030 Vision
Saudi Arabia vision 2030 cuts back conventional reliance on oil, that can potentially move Saudi Arabia toward creating a less oil-centered, more environmentally-focused economy. The Kingdom also aims to lower annual carbon emissions up to 130 million tons by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2060 by investing in clean energy projects, including solar energy masses.

### Problem Statement
Weather and climate affect people around the world. Rising global temperatures are expected to raise sea levels, and change precipitation and other local climate conditions.

### Goal
The goal in our project is to predict the air Temperature by using Machine Learning with PySpark. We will analyze the data and create a model for the prediction. We aim to explore the relations between climate variables such as air temperate, wind, Sky condition, Visibility and Dew.

### Dataset
We will train our model with Saudi Arabia hourly climate integrated surface data with the below data observations:
1. Wind
2. Sky condition
3. Visibility
4. Air temperature
5. Dew
6. Sea level pressure
The dataset contains 1852380 rows and 35 columns. it contains data from the year 2017 till 2022.

### Dashboards
After cleaning and processed the dataset we used Tableau to create dashboards to find insights within the dataset. We created Two dashboards where each of them is sharing a coherent story.
